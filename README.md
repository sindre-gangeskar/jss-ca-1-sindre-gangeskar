## Instructions
NodeJS is **required** in order to run this program. NodeJS can be acquired from here: https://nodejs.org/en

Once NodeJS is installed, navigate to the project's root folder and open the terminal from there. 
If it's the first time running the application, run command **npm install** to install all dependencies.
Use **npm start** to launch the application after all dependencies are installed. 

Access the application by opening your favorite browser and typing in http://localhost:3000 in the address bar while the server is running.

Shut down the server by pressing **CTRL + C** in the server terminal window and follow with a **Y** as an answer. 
If you closed the window and the server is still running, you can find the NodeJS javascript runtime as a task you can end in the task manager.
